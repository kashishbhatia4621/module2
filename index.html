                <h2>TIME MANAGEMENT</h2>
                <p>
                    Time management means rightly managing the time available to one. Time is significant, and it must not be wasted. One can always do much in a little time; hence so much to accomplish. Time management is especially essential for students, as they have to study various subjects in a limited period.

                <p>
                    If only we could have smooth relationships and perfect circumstances at all times! But the mystics remind us that this creation is itself an imperfection â€“ a characteristic of duality. So, are we seeking the impossible? As human beings travelling on the spiritual path, we are in the process of becoming perfect.
